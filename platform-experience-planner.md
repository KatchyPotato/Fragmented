Computer:

The game will be optimized for a computer. Graphics, controls, and experience would be most enjoyed playing with a keyboard and mouse. Different items would have different hot-keys, so the player can have as much customization as they want. Main weapons will be used with a mouse. Any pop-ups will be controlled with the mouse.

Phone:

The game will have buttons that appear on the screen. A joystick for movement, a button for attacking, and more buttons for items, inventory, etc. Inside the game menu, the user can change the button size for their comfort. They will use their fingers for pop-ups, but inventories and menus will have larger slots and less rows. The game should only be played in landscape. If the phone is flipped, nothing will actually happen to the game. It stays static. Visuals and particles will be simplified, so the game appears less-busy. 

Accessibility:

Interaction is text-based. Explosions, particles, and stunning visuals remove the need for listening. If the user does want to have sound visualized, subtitles will be added to the top-left of the screen. Any sounds that are played will be written out in text. E.g. “Grass Rustles” “Player takes damage” “Monster growls”. Inside the game settings, the user can set the game language to whatever they want. 

Reflection:

To optimize the game for a Phone, visuals and gameplay had to be re-worked. The game is still meant to be played on a computer, but giving the option to play on a phone expands the player base. Knowing how to reduce visuals, and where to place buttons, will help me  when I make digital screen designs. I feel confident in adding buttons or mobile users, as I have had experience with Minecraft Pocket Edition. Mojang was forced to make many changes for the game so it could be played on a smaller device. How to improve the game for color-blindess will probably be tricky for me, as the game is very visuals-driven.
