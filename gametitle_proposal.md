Name

Name: ***Fragmented***. The word *fragmented* implies something made up of multiple pieces. Similarly, the game has multiple layers. The physical journey the player takes, as well as the mental journey within. The main character, though strong in physical combat, suffers from depression and a scattered/broken mind. The player finds peace and contentment at the end of the game, after they have pulled together the mental fragments that have been scattered. 

Genre

* Core Genre:

   **Action**  
\-The main gameplay will be continuous action through combat and the transversal of your environment. The player is led into continuous states of *action*. 

* Scrolling/Perspective:

   **Multi-directional**  
\-The game is an isometric perspective. The player is free to move about as they please in a given area. For instance, if they are in a dungeon, the player has access to any area they previously cleared. 

* Movement & Abilities:

   **Flying/Gliding**  
\-The player is equipped with a cloak that allows them to glide in the air for short periods of time. This can be used for getting around, and to enhance movement in combat situations. 

* Action/Conflict:

   **Combat**  
\-The game is primarily combat based, with large amounts of enemies to eliminate with various weapons. The game will include a very wide variety of enemies, weapons and items. This gives the game multiple play-styles for the player to choose from. (e.g. tank, ranged, strategical, fast, tactical.) 

* Structure/Progression:

   **Linear**  
\-The game does not allow much user interference with the story and progression. The story is fixed, as well as where the player progresses to next. It’s not so strict that the player has no room to explore or branch off, but it does not allow for massive deviation from the game’s progression. 

* Aesthetic/Tone:

   **Dark**  
\-This tone is shown through the environment, visuals, sounds, styles, and enemies. This reflects the mental journey the player is going through. 

* Challenge Style:

   **Exploration**  
\-In order to progress in an area, such as a dungeon or village, the player must complete side-quests and activities. For instance, the player would have to clear rooms of monsters, assist a prisoner in need, or solve a puzzle to get a key to open a door. The world is interesting and vast, with many complex NPCs to interact with. The player should not shy away from being curious. 

Backstory

*The world is a broken, dark place. It is devoid of green nature, fresh air, and expansive beauty. Monsters roam free, tyrants rule with iron fists. A constant state of depression is everywhere. It didn’t used to be this way. Before the time of the player, the world was good. Its inhabitants lived normal lives, unhindered by dark forces. But something went drastically wrong.*   
*The Shadows underneath the world's crust started to stir. Banished to the void by the goddesses, the Shadows lived in a place devoid of anything good. Jealous of what the surface had to offer, they started forming monsters to send out and destroy anything that the shadows didn’t have. Little by little, the world fell into darkness and evil. The player, the simple daughter of a blacksmith, lost her family and friends to a raid on their village. Burdened with grief and depression, the player sets out to destroy the forces that took away her family.* 

Characters

Protagonist: A blacksmith of a simple village named *Reyna*. Her family has been stripped away by monsters. She wears only red colors, in defiance to the dark nature of the world. She has raven-black hair that hides her eyes, coming halfway down her back. She suffers from a constant state of depression and grief. Her mind is scattered and broken. 

Antagonists: The Shadows that stir underneath the world, in a 4-dimensional space known as the void. They are the essence of evil, banished there by the goddesses. 

Eiya: The goddess of land. She created the physical world and universe. 

Kiya: The goddess of life. She created everything that lives in the world, from the humans to the monsters.

Siya: The goddess of time. She wrote the history of the world. The past, present, and future are all made known to her.

Kai: A traveling blacksmith and merchant. He can be found anywhere you look, from dungeons to mountains to valleys. 
He sells Reyna weapons and tools to assist her on her journey.

Seil: A pointoneer trained in the art of alchemy. His prices are high, and he can be hard to find, but he sells the best potions. 
He can be lurking anywhere, but he doesn't stay in once place for very long.

Muchka: A mischievous boy of 13. Every time Reyna meets him, he always has something new for sale.
His merchandise seems to be acquired through... unconventional practices. It's hard to get a strait answer out of him when it comes to business. 

Limbo: A mutant creature with no body, except for a tangle of arms and legs protruding from its nucleus.
The nucleus is its only weak spot, but is heavily protected by multiple arms. It can climb up walls, swim with ease, 
traverse it's environment easily, and wield a variety of weapons and items with its limbs.

Vaax: A tricky, shifty joker. He treats battles like games, rather than life-death situations.
He's very difficult to defeat, due to his abilities to teleport, summon items, and manipulate the environment around him.

Bai and Bo: Although they look like an innocent pair of twins, the two brothers thrive off thievery and deception.
They love chaos, and won't fall short of violence to get what they want. Not many know that they are actually the sons of Vaax. 

Noxious: A master of magic and sorcery, Noxious spends most of her abilities on house-keeping and gardening. 
She is married to Vaax, but the two separated due to disagreements on how to raise the twins. 
Although she puts on a bored and careless demeaner, she won't hesitate to eliminate those who oppose her. 

Hectate: The darkest invention of the Shadows, Hectate is a vile spirit that takes on the form of its opponent. 
Hectate reflects every negative aspect of its opponent, so that you are basically fighting an evil version of yourself. 
Hectate brings out the worst in people, and grows more powerful with every human it defeats.

Inspirations & Competition

Wandersong: The journey of a bard intent on saving the world. You control your environment with your songs, meeting new people and developing relationships. It includes puzzles, platforming, and an engaging story. I take an engaging story from this game.  

Wuppo: A story of a small, insignificant creature in a large and vast world. After being thrown out of your home, you set out to find a new place to stay, while learning more about the world you’re in. I take world building from this game. 

My game would compete with GRIS:

GRIS is a visual, solitary platformer following a person's journey through the five stages of grief. My game also includes a mental journey, and enticing visuals. My game offers combat, however, offering more engaging gameplay than that of GRIS. 

Goals:

I want the players to feel:

* Sadness in relation to the story and mental state of the main character.  
* Wonder in relation to the vast and interesting world the character lives in.   
* Fear of the monsters and dark forces in the world.   
* Contentment when the player restores goodness to the world, connects the fragments of their broken mind, and reaches a state of mental peace.
